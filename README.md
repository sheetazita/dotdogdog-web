#dotdotdog-web

My 1st project will be a website information of different breeds of dogs.  My passion of building this website is because I’m a dog lover, and I just believe it will be so great if there’s a website, or an app that can simply deliver all kinds of dog information to dog owners, in their handy ways.  Through my website, users could get to connect with their dogs more by knowing more information, what their dogs like, what are healthy to their dogs, why their dogs behave in certain ways. 

The API website I am going to connect with is called “https://www.fitbark.com/dev/“.  This is an amazing website with more than 2000+ information of dogs, plus providing pictures.

The most difficult part of build my website is how to grab the data I want from the API, and customize it the style I want when the datas display on my web page.  

I would also want to add a subscription button so users could get updates from the website, but this is a feature beyond my skills, and I need to consult with my instructor or obtain solutions online.  

The dog stories and videos are features I have to constantly update, which could boost up the SEO of my website.  Once my website is successfully run and eventually get audience, I look forward to run it as a commercial website, and I will build a sister site call "dotdotCats"
